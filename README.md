# oss-graph

A simple website to display the graph of code reviews in open source projects on GitHub.

Next steps:

* Build a nice Material Design front end
* Add a [force-directed](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045) or [sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/) graph and a table of centrality.  Note that the `node_link_data` provided by the function is already in the correct format (see [this page](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/json_graph.html)).
